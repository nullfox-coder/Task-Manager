# Requirements for Unix-Inspired Task Management Service

## Functional Requirements

### Core Task Management
1. **Task Creation (Fork)**
   - Create new tasks with unique identifiers
   - Ability to specify task properties (name, description)
   - Optional ability to create a task as a "child" of another task

2. **Task Listing (LS)**
   - List all tasks in the system
   - Filter tasks based on status (optional)
   - Sort tasks by creation time, ID, or other properties (optional)

3. **Task Retrieval**
   - Retrieve details of a specific task by ID
   - Include task lineage information (parent-child relationships)

4. **Task Termination**
   - Remove/delete tasks by ID
   - Update task status (e.g., mark as completed)

### Data Persistence
1. **Task Storage**
   - Store tasks persistently across service restarts
   - Maintain task creation timestamps
   - Store task lineage information (parent-child relationships)

2. **Task Status Tracking**
   - Track the current status of each task (e.g., running, completed, failed)
   - Maintain task history (optional)

## API Requirements

1. **RESTful Endpoints**
   - `GET /tasks` - List all tasks
   - `GET /tasks/frequent` - Retrieve frequently accessed tasks
   - `POST /tasks` - Create a new task
   - `GET /tasks/{id}` - Get details of a specific task
   - `DELETE /tasks/{id}` - Remove a task
   - `PATCH /tasks/{id}` - Update task properties/status

2. **Request/Response Format**
   - All API endpoints should accept and return JSON formatted data
   - Include appropriate HTTP status codes for success/error conditions
   - Return detailed error messages for failed requests

3. **API Documentation**
   - Document all endpoints, request parameters, and response formats
   - Provide example requests and responses

## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - The service should handle listing of at least 1000 tasks efficiently
   - Task creation time should be under 100ms
   - API endpoints should respond within 200ms under normal load

2. **Reliability**
   - The service should continue functioning after errors
   - Data consistency should be maintained even during abnormal shutdowns
   - Implement appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms

3. **Scalability**
   - The design should allow for horizontal scaling of the service (optional)
   - Database design should support future growth in task volume

4. **Security**
   - Validate all input to prevent injection attacks
   - Implement authentication and authorization (optional)
   - Secure sensitive data in storage and transit (if applicable)

5. **Maintainability**
   - Follow clean code principles
   - Implement separation of concerns
   - Include appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring
   - Write meaningful tests (unit, integration)

## Technical Constraints

1. **API Design**
   - RESTful API design principles
   - HTTP/HTTPS protocols
   - JSON for data exchange

2. **Persistence**
   - Use a database or persistent storage solution of choice
   - Ensure data integrity during concurrent operations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of invalid requests
   - Clear error messages for clients
   - Appropriate logging of errors for monitoring

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for core business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Documentation for running tests

## Delivery Requirements

1. **Documentation**
   - README with setup instructions
   - API documentation
   - System architecture overview

2. **Code Quality**
   - Well-structured, readable code
   - Appropriate comments and documentation
   - Consistent coding style

3. **Source Control**
   - Organized commit history
   - Clear commit messages
